Here’s a concise description you can include in your GitHub README (or repo description) to explain what your Spring Boot CRUD app does and how it’s structured:

## Spring Boot CRUD App with Soft-Delete and DTO Layer

This is a simple Spring Boot application demonstrating a standard layered architecture for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) service managing books. It follows best practices you’d see in real-world Java projects:

1. **Domain Model & Persistence**

   * **`BookEntity`** is a JPA-annotated class mapped to a database table. It includes fields for `id`, `bookname`, `author`, `price` and an `activeSw` flag used for soft-deletes.
   * Uses **Spring Data JPA** (`BookRepo`) to perform database operations without boilerplate code.

2. **DTO Layer**

   * **`BookRequestDTO`** captures only the client’s input (`bookname`, `author`, `price`).
   * **`BookResponseDto`** defines exactly what the API returns (also `bookname`, `author`, `price`), hiding internal fields like `id` and `activeSw`.
   * Keeps entities decoupled from API contracts, making future changes safer and simpler.

3. **Service Layer**

   * **`BookServiceInterface`** defines business operations: create, read all, read by id, update, soft-delete.
   * **`BookServiceImpl`** implements those operations, handling default values (`activeSw = "T"`), soft-delete logic, and error handling for “not found” or “deleted” cases.

4. **REST Controller**

   * **`BookController`** maps HTTP verbs to service calls with clear, RESTful endpoints (`POST /book/create`, `GET /book/getAll`, `GET /book/getbyid/{id}`, `PUT /book/update/{id}`, `DELETE /book/delete/{id}`).
   * Uses `@RequestBody` and `@PathVariable` to bind JSON inputs and URL parameters, and `ResponseEntity` to control HTTP status codes and response bodies.

5. **Validation & Extensibility**

   * All DTOs support easy addition of validation annotations (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Size`) without touching your entities.
   * You can plug in MapStruct or ModelMapper for automatic object mapping as the app grows.

6. **Getting Started**

   1. Clone the repo
   2. Update `application.properties` for your database settings
   3. Run `mvn spring-boot:run` (or via your IDE)
   4. Access endpoints on `http://localhost:8080/book/...`

This structure showcases your grasp of clean code principles, layer separation, and Spring Boot conventions—making it a strong portfolio piece for recruiters and collaborators.
